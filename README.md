# 🧠 Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement **Logistic Regression** using only NumPy and Matplotlib — no ML libraries. It predicts whether a student passes or fails based on study hours.

## 🔧 Features
- Custom implementation of logistic regression
- Sigmoid & cost function
- Gradient descent optimization
- Plotting decision boundary and cost variation

## 📊 Dataset
A small dataset showing how many hours a student studied and whether they passed (1) or not (0).

## 📈 Output
- Accuracy printed in console
- Plot of cost over iterations
- Plot of decision boundary curve

## ▶️ Run it
```bash
python logistic_regression.py
